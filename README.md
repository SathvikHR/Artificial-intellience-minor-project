# Mutli-Class-image-classification-using-CNN-in-Python-AI-Project-
This project is Multi-class Image classification using Convolutional Neural Network developed using Python programming language.
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
The CNN Model is optimized by adding Dropout layer to get the overall accuracy of testing phase to 93 percent.
